Change LOGS

Very important: Continous actions are now allowed (previous ple version didn't allow that). For that I changed keydown to keypress and changed indentation, need to make sure that is okay for the DQN. 

1) Created a custom map via text, which puts 1 for platform, 2 for ladder, and 3 for coins.

2) This way we don't need any of the board.py functions that generate the coins, platforms, or ladders by themselves.

3) We can now also create different colored platforms or ladders easily, by giving the different platforms various numbers and simply putting different textures on them. 

4) Removing object prior information is also easy

5) Create 3 maps for various priors

6) Figure out to shorten the map, and also where the initial position of the player is

7) Need to make sure rewards are being generated properly

8) Need to make sure coins Collected function doesn't create problem for DQN
